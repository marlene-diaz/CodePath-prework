**Code2025** is an app that changes background color with labels [TODO]

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
    Facebook:
    -Displays Events near you
    -Displays what others liked
    Instragram:
    -Displays videos with algorithm
    -Has polls where followers can participate
    Youtube:
    -Creators uploading long videos for others to easily access
    -Saved playlists for users to watch later, keeping tabs

My idea for an app is to have a Virtual Assistant, it keeps track of your behavioral movements.
Where it can arrange meetings and tell you to take breaks when needed or telling you verbal reminders.
It can keep track of everything in your life while avoiding long working hours. avoids Stress overload.
it automatically give you suggestions ex: "Would you like me to move your 4 o'clock" and can make references to
movies that you watch.
    


## Notes

Learning where the tools were took some time.
It is hard to open so many windows at the same time
